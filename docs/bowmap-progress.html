<p>My goal is to have some kind of tangible progress every single day.</p>

<p>November 11, 2025, 66 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alright, I am here.</li>
  <li>I'm going to rewrite the server. This isn't actually as bad as it sounds. The server is damn tiny right now, and built on a pretty fragile base. Starting over isn't too much of an issue.</li>
  <li>I need to handle clients, serialize their packets, and feed those into a system to handle them. That's really it :p</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>November uh 9... 2025, 68 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>I have been informed that there are 68 days until release...</li>
  <li>This is NOT good news</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 24, 2025, 84 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>Okay I have actually been working on the server I just keep forgetting to update this -.-</li>
  <li>Pretty sure that large rewrite is done, just some bugs I need to fix :p</li>
  <li>After this I'm going to try to work on smaller things and finish them before I move on to the next thing because god rewriting multiple things at once is a nightmare and I don't know why I keep doing it (maybe I have learned :p)</li>
  <li>After this I still need a decent rule system to start actually doing anything interesting :(</li>
  <li>Yes I've been working on that for like a month or something but don't worry about it ._.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 22, 2025, 86 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>I seriously need to learn to stop undergoing large refactors, they're just never a good idea...</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 21, 2025, 87 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>No se</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 20, 2025, 88 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>Nothing! I was very busy (and lazy) today :(</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 19, 2025, 89 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pulling apart the server and doing a rather large rewrite of its main logic.</li>
  <li>Still don't have a good rule system, so that needs to happen, and then I can handle packets and respond to them in a reasonable way.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 18, 2025, 90 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>Side note, spec annoys me sometimes</li>
  <li>But anyways, there's still stuff to rewrite. I gotta finish this rule/event system so I can not go crazy. And then there's still a lot of mess :p</li>
  <li>Project crossed 1000 lines which is neat. The majority of that is codecs and packets but still (and I'm in the middle of a rewrite)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 17, 2025, 91 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>I'll try to remember to update this lol</li>
  <li>Continuing that rewrite :p</li>
  <li>Mostly boring, but it needs to get done</li>
  <li>After this I think I will work on blocks and chunks</li>
  <li>Besides blocks, there are also items, inventories, entities, the player, and a bunch of other things to do :p</li>
  <li>And that's just sort of "vanilla interop" things, not even the more interesting non-vanilla things I want to do!</li>
  <li>Big plans, no idea how much of that will be realized in 90 days but there will hopefully be at least something :p</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 16, 2025, 92 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>Did a lot, fixed some bugs, did texture pack work, started rewriting some things that desperately need rewritten!</li>
  <li>I found some texture pack tweaks I can use to make the world look very interesting and much less like vanilla Minecraft, which is super cool.</li>
  <li>I think the game is starting to have its own kind of art style that I'm trying to nail down. I have a general vibe of what I want, but there are lot of blocks to make and I don't have all that much experience with pixel art - I've mostly just done items and not blocks (blocks are hard :p)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 8, 2025, 100 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>BUSY, just some thinking</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>October 7, 2025, 101 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>Another time skip ._.</li>
  <li>Erm I got chunks working, at least chunks with only a single type of block in them</li>
  <li>And I broke the server and now I'm trying to fix it. I broke it like 2 days ago and now I honestly can't remember what's broken about it, so that's fun</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>September 27, 2025, 111 days until release</p>

<ul>
  <li>Time skip, hello!</li>
  <li>Been a few days, got a little bit done, and a decent amount of thinking, but not much farther</li>
  <li>Next up is chunks, but there are some things I need to do before then.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>September 22, 2025, 117 days until release</p>

<ul>
