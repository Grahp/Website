We may write them down, but it's very imprecise, and has no real coordination with your dictionary.<ul><li>I'm not entirely sure what a theory rule is, or how they work. This model is built around a two-step rule application phase, with asynchronous application and a combination step. This has some nice qualities, though is potentially not the best way to go about rule application.</ul><h3 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h3><p>When we think of dictionaries, we tend to think of something like a JSON dict. However, a dictionary is not necessarily a static enumerated file of entries. This idea is where theory staticness comes from.<p>A dictionary is just a lookup function. A literal mathematical function of entries to translations.<ul><li>There's also outline splitting, which is potentially the same problem</ul><h3 id="uberdictionary">Uberdictionary</h3><p>(See <a class="wiki-link"href="/uberdictionary">uberdictionary</a>)<p>An uberdictionary is a collection of translations with context about their origin, pronunciation, and other pertinent attributes.<p>With an uberdict, you can write context for translations once, and all theories using that uberdict get that context for free.<p>With a rule-based theory, you get new entries for free!<h3 id="rule-application">Rule Application</h3><ul><li>Again, not sure exactly how rules work, but this is just one idea I had.</ul><p>A rule takes the outline input as it's given, and returns <strong>information</strong> for the combiner.<p>That information might be pronunciation data, an orthographic sequence, etc.<p>Take a rule that needs a translation. Since rules are just given an outline, that rule cannot apply yet, it needs more context. That implies that there are multiple types of rules. Perhaps cyclical rule application is needed, or "post" rules that run in a batch after all others.<h2 id="problems">Problems</h2><h3 id="combination">Combination</h3><p>What does the combination step really entail?<p>Rules are fully decoupled from combination, which might make it hard for the combiner to be able to combine outputs effectively.<h3 id="reverse-lookup">Reverse Lookup</h3><p>Reverse lookup (also known as "outline lookup") is just like lookup, but takes translations and returns outlines that form that translation.<p>This is very important for learning a theory, as well as catching errors in theory logic.<p>If entries are only ever determined when they're needed (i.e. if only lookup is supported, and not reverse lookup), catching theory logic errors might be harder, and learning a theory via reverse lookup would be completely impossible.<p>When generating a static dict, you can validate the entries as they are generated, but with a programmatic dict, you're generating the entries on-the-fly.<p>Exhaustively looking up plausible outlines is also not feasible. Lookup is too slow, and outlines too plentiful. Rules need to be able to generate valid outlines for that rule, and theories need to be able to generate valid outlines for the theory.<ul><li>Maybe <a class="wiki-link"href="/clojure">spec</a> could help with this?</ul><h3 id="uberdictionary-1">Uberdictionary</h3><p>How do you represent an <a class="wiki-link"href="/uberdictionary">uberdictionary</a>?</main><script type="module"src="/assets/js/app.js"></script>
