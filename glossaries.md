# Glossaries

Words are fun!

As I've been maintaining glossaries for my [projects](projects.md), I find it interesting just how much knowledge is accreted when maintaining a glossary.
You really have to get to the roots of things. Finding the right words is not hard once you actually understand what something means. You're forced to understand things if you want to be able to communicate them effectively.
