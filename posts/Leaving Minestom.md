# Leaving Minestom

Minestom is great. I just don't like it.

it's pretty hard to make something like a minecraft server, which requires a lot of communication, without a considerable interface. in the case of minestom, i do not like this interface.

- Mutable Player classes, Instance, etc.

At the end of the day, it's still a large java project, and I don't want to work with it.
