# Leaving Minestom

Minestom is great. I just don't like it.

It's pretty hard to make something like a minecraft server, which requires a lot of communication, without a considerable interface. In the case of minestom, i do not like this interface.

- Mutable Player classes, Instance, etc.

At the end of the day, [it's still a large java project](clojure.md), and I don't want to work with it.
