# Onyx Spec

WIP [Onyx](../onyx.md) specification.

## Layout
![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-orange?style=flat)

Onyx uses the full Extended Stenotype Layout ([https://github.com/sammdot/plover-stenotype-extended](https://github.com/sammdot/plover-stenotype-extended)).

### Starter Initial Sounds

- `S-` → /s/
- `T-` → /t/
- `K-` → /k/
- `P-` → /p/
- `W-` → /w/
- `H-` → /h/
- `R-` → /ɹ/
- `SKWR-` → /ʤ/, /ʒ/
- `SH-` → /ʃ/
- `TKPW-` → /ɡ/
- `TP-` → /f/
- `TPH-` → /n/
- `HR-` → /l/
- `PH-` → /m/
- `TK-` → /d/
- `PW-` → /b/
- `KWR-` → /j/
- `STKPW-` → /z/
- `KH-` → /ʧ/
- `TH-` → /θ/, /ð/
- `SW-` → /sw/, /sv/

TODO orthographic exceptions

TODO `KWR` and `W` in subsequent stroke and `W` in subsequent strokess

### Key Usage
![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-orange?style=flat)

## Onyx Splitting

Every consecutive stroke after the first stroke of a multi-stroke outline is skeletonized.

This means that skeleton strokes may not be used for briefs, or otherwise.

Onyx splitting avoids all word boundary conflicts, and introduces remarkably few conflicts.

## Briefing
![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-orange?style=flat)

Arbitrary briefs are used very rarely in Onyx. I believe these are very personal, and shouldn't be dictated by your theory.
