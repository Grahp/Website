# Onyx Spec

WIP [Onyx](../onyx.md) specification.

## Layout
![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-orange?style=flat)

Onyx uses the full Extended Stenotype Layout ([https://github.com/sammdot/plover-stenotype-extended](https://github.com/sammdot/plover-stenotype-extended)).

### Key Usage
![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-orange?style=flat)

## Onyx Splitting
![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-orange?style=flat)

Every consecutive stroke after the first stroke of a multi-stroke outline is skeletonized.

## Briefing
![TODO](https://img.shields.io/badge/TODO-orange?style=flat)

Arbitrary briefs are used very rarely in Onyx. I believe these are very personal, and shouldn't be dictated by your theory.
