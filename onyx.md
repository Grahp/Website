# Onyx

Onyx is a WIP [steno](steno.md) dictionary.

My Theory Beliefs:
(See [Quartz](quartz.md))
- Inconsistencies are annoying when learning, but they're far more dangerous when you have to build on top of a shaky theory.
- Smaller theories are easier to learn and easier to build off of.
- Offering speed is just as important as consistency in write-outs.

Onyx Goals:
- Templated one stroke briefs for everything
- Consistency
- Solid foundation for user briefing
- Be as tiny as possible
