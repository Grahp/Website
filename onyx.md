# Onyx

Onyx is a WIP [steno](steno.md) dictionary.

My Theory Beliefs:
(See [Quartz](quartz.md))
- Inconsistencies are annoying when learning. They are incredibly dangerous when you have to build on top of a shaky theory.
- Small theories are much easier to build on.
- Speed and write-outs are just as important.

Onyx Goals:
- Templated one stroke briefs for everything
- Solid foundation for user briefing
- Consistency
- Be as tiny as possible
