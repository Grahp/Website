# Onyx

Onyx is a WIP [steno](steno.md) dictionary.

See [Onyx Spec](onyx/spec.md)

My Theory Beliefs:
(See [Quartz](quartz.md))
- Inconsistencies are annoying when learning. They are incredibly dangerous when you have to build on top of a shaky theory.
- Small theories are much easier to build on.
- Briefs and write-outs are equally important.

Onyx Goals:
- Templated one stroke briefs for everything
- Solid foundation for user briefing
- Consistency
- Be as tiny as possible

## Theory Size

Smaller things are easier to learn, easier to build on, easier to understand, easier to maintain, easier to keep consistent, easier to document...

## Consistency

Inconsistencies propagate. Extending an inconsistent foundation is a mess.
