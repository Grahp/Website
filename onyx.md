# Onyx

WIP [steno](steno.md) [theory](steno-glossary.md#theory).

See [Onyx Spec](onyx/spec.md).

My Theory Beliefs:
(See [Quartz](quartz.md))
- Inconsistencies are annoying when learning. They are incredibly dangerous when you have to build on top of a shaky theory.
- Small theories are better.
- [Briefs](steno-glossary.md#brief) and [write-outs](steno-glossary.md#write-out) are equally important.

Onyx Goals:
- Consistency
- Theory minimality
- Solid foundation for user briefing
- Provide a solid foundation for user briefing
- Brief [templates](steno-glossary.md#template)

## Theory Size

Smaller ~~theories~~ things are easier to learn, easier to build on, easier to understand, easier to maintain, easier to keep consistent, easier to document...

What impacts theory size?
- Number of [rules](steno-glossary.md#theory-rule)
- [Mandatory outlines](steno-glossary.md#mandatory)
- [Arbitrary briefs](steno-glossary.md#arbitrary-brief)

## Consistency

Inconsistencies propagate. Extending an inconsistent foundation is a mess.
