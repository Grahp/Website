# Uberdictionary

An uberdictionary in [steno](steno.md) is a collection of translations with context about their pronunciations, orthography, origin, etc.

With an uberdictionary, you can write context for translations once, and every single theory that uses the uberdictionary can use those translations without having to create them anew.

If you're using a rule-based generated dictionary (via [Quartz](quartz.md) or others), you get new entries completely for free.

Theories should be able to choose what translations they support, and build rules around them without immense effort.

This is a very important concept in [Quartz](quartz.md).
