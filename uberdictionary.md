# Uberdictionary

Theoretical [steno](steno.md) collection of translations with information about their pronunciations, orthography, origin, etc.

With an uberdictionary, you can write descriptions for translations once, and every single theory that uses the uberdictionary can use those translations.

If you're using a rule-based generated dictionary (via [Quartz](quartz.md), froj ([https://github.com/StenoHarri/Froj](https://github.com/StenoHarri/Froj)), etc.), you get new entries completely for free.

Every theory having their own set of supported translations is not good. Theories should be able to choose what translations they want to support (which is probably "the most amount possible"), and get support for those translations without immense manual effort.
