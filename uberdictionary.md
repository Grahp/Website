# Uberdict

Write descriptions for words, including pronunciation and spelling, and every singly theory that uses the uberdict gets them **for free**.

If you're using a rule-based theory ([quartz](quartz.md), froj ([https://github.com/StenoHarri/Froj](https://github.com/StenoHarri/Froj)), etc.), you get new entries completely for free.
