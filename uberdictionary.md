# Uberdictionary

Theoretical [steno](steno.md) collection of translations with information about their pronunciations and orthography.

With an uberdictionary, you can write descriptions for words once, and every single theory that uses the uberdictionary can use those words without any additional effort.

If you're using a rule-based generated dictionary (via [Quartz](quartz.md), froj ([https://github.com/StenoHarri/Froj](https://github.com/StenoHarri/Froj)), etc.), you get new entries without having to add anything.

Every dictionary having their own set of words with entries is incredibly wasteful. You shouldn't have theories that support words that other theories don't. That's just not good.
