# Plan

I need somewhere to throw things.
I'm going to try not to ever change anything, or to think to hard about things.

Nothing serial (serial content sucks), just a tree ([trees are awesome](clojure.md)).
Maybe not [32 links per page](clojure.md), but something like that.

Perhaps it's more of a graph, not a tree, but whatever.
