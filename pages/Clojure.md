Clojure ([https://clojure.org](https://clojure.org)) is a functional [[Lisp|Lisp]] for the JVM! Something cool to know about Clojure is that it is NOT Java®, they're very different [[Programming Languages|languages]] :)

[[Home|I]] quit programming in 2023 after learning Java and figuring that's what real programming was (I had made a few web games and toy projects in Python and JS before that), but eventually came back to write [[Bowmap|Bowmap]] and figured Clojure would be as far away from Java as I could get :p

I've been enjoying it ever since :D
