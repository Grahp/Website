Cool [[Lisp|language]]. ([https://clojure.org](https://clojure.org))

Something cool to know about Clojure is that it is NOT JavaÂ®, they're very different languages :)

[[Home|I'm]] Writing a couple things in Clojure, but check out [[Bowmap|Bowmap]].

I'm also making my own [[Lisp|Lisp]] for [[Lua|Lua]] inspired by Clojure called [[Faddle|Faddle]] :p
