[[Home|I]]'m no longer actively involved in Steno, so this is more of an archive. I plan on returning here and better organizing what I have learned over my time with steno.

I spent about 9 months working on [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theories]], and learned a lot from that that I'd like to share at some point.

For now, here are some random pages:

- [[Pinchord|Pinchord]] - Orthographic Steno Theory
- [[Quartz|Quartz]] - Programmatic Dictionary Generation

- [[Steno Glossary|Steno Glossary]]
- [[Uberdictionary|Uberdictionary]]
- [[Steno Notation|Steno Notation]]
- [[Steno Editor Ideas|Steno Editor Ideas]]
- [[Programmatic Dictionaries Rule|Programmatic Dictionaries Rule]]
