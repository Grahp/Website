WIP rewrite of [[Home|my]] [[Steno Glossary|Steno Glossary]]. This should be easier to understand, and less unnecessarily technical.

Links to other words are _italicized_. Links to other pages are not.

Outline:
- [_Key_](#key)
- [_Chord_](#chord)
- [_Stroke_](#stroke)
- [_Outline_](#outline)

## Key
**Noun**

An individual key on a _steno machine_ or _layout_. Analogous to a key on a keyboard.

- In _raw steno notation_, keys are written as their "face letter", plus a dash `-` denoting which _bank_ they are in.
- For example, in the _WSI layout_, there are two keys labeled '`S`': the _initial_ `S-` key, and the _final_ `-S` key. Notice the dash at the start and end of the key.

## Chord
**Noun**

A set, or group, of [_keys_](#key). Chords may denote a sound, letter, affix, or any other part of a _translation_.

- Chords can be combined to form [_strokes_](#stroke).
- The difference between a chord and a [_stroke_](#stroke) can often be subtle. See [[Chords vs. Strokes]].
- An example chord is `TPH-`, which _translates_ to the _initial_ "n" sound (/n/)

**Verb**

Pressing down all the [_keys_](#key) that make up a chord on a _steno machine_.

"Chording" is a term outside of _steno_, which means "pressing multiple [_keys_](#key) together at once", rather than one at a time.

- Often used interchangeably with the verb [_stroke_](#stroke).

## Stroke
**Noun**

A set, or group, or [_keys_](#key) pressed together simultaneously.

- If that sounds like what a [_chord_](#chord) is, that's because [_chords_](#chord) and strokes are very similar. They are both sets of [_keys_](#key). When you press down a set of [_keys_] simultaneously, that is a stroke. A [_chord_](#chord) is something you can use to build strokes.
- A helpful way to think of it is that when you combine two [_chords_](#chord), you get a stroke, but when you combine two strokes, you get an [_outline_](#outline)
- For a full explanation of the difference between [_chords_](#chord) and strokes, see [[Chords vs. Strokes]].

**Verb**

Pressing down all the [_keys_](#key) that make up a stroke on a _steno machine_.

## Outline
**Noun**

One or more [_strokes_](#stroke) [_chorded_](#chord), or pressed, in sequence.
