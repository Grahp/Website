## Key
**Noun**

An individual key on a _steno machine_ or _layout_. Analogous to a key on a keyboard.

- Multiple keys may share the same "label", with a dash (-) denoting what _bank_ the key is in.. For example, in the _WSI layout_, there are two keys labeled '`S`': the _initial_ `S-` key, and the _final_ `-S` key. Notice the dash at the start and end of the key.

## Chord
**Noun**

A set, or group, of [_keys_](#key). Chords may denote a sound, letter, affix, or any other part of a _translation_.

- Chords can be combined to form [_strokes_](#stroke).
- The difference between a chord and a [_stroke_](#stroke) can often be subtle. See [[Chords vs. Strokes]].
- An example chord is `TPH-`, which _translates_ to the _initial_ "n" sound (/n/).

**Verb**

Pressing down all the [_keys_](#key) that make up a chord on a _steno machine_.

- "Chording" is a term outside of _steno_, which means "pressing multiple [_keys_](#key) together at once", rather than one at a time.
- Often used interchangeably with the verb [_stroke_](#stroke).

## Stroke
**Noun**

A set, or group, or [_keys_](#key) pressed together simultaneously.

- If that sounds like what a [_chord_](#chord) is, that's because [_chords_](#chord) and strokes are very similar. They are both sets of [_keys_](#key). When you press down a set of [_keys_](#key) simultaneously, that is a stroke. A [_chord_](#chord) is something you can use to build strokes.
- A helpful way to think of it is that when you combine two [_chords_](#chord), you get a stroke, but when you combine two strokes, you get an [_outline_](#outline)
- For a full explanation of the difference between [_chords_](#chord) and strokes, see [[Chords vs. Strokes]].

**Verb**

Pressing down all the [_keys_](#key) that make up a stroke on a _steno machine_.

- Often used interchangeably with the verb [_chord_](#chord).

## Outline
**Noun**

One or more [_strokes_](#stroke) [_chorded_](#chord), or pressed, in sequence.

## Translation
**Noun**

A word, phrase, part of a word or phase, sound, affix, command, punctuation, or any other output.

**Verb**

To "translate". The translation that an [_outline_](#outline) maps to is referred to as its "translation".

- For example, the [_outline_](#outline) `KAT` translates to "cat".

## Entry
**Noun**

An entry, or [_dictionary_](#dictionary) entry, is a mapping between an [_outline_](#outline) and a [_translation_](#translation).

- For example, the [_outline_](#outline) `HOT/TKOG` might map to the [_translation_](#translation) "hotdog".

## Dictionary
**Noun**

A set of [_outlines_](#outline) with mappings to [_translations_](#translation). Dictionaries are made up of dictionary [_entries_](#entry).

## Lookup
**Noun**

The process of "looking up" a [_translation_](#translation) in a [_dictionary_](#dictionary).

## Reverse Lookup
**Noun**

The process of "lookup up" the [_outlines_](#outlines) that map to a given [_translation_](#translation) in a [_dictionary_](#dictionary).

- Called "reverse lookup" as it is the opposite of regular [_lookup_](#lookup).

## Theory Rule
**Noun**

A "rule" defining some part of how [_outlines_](#outline) should be mapped to [_translations_](#translation).

## Theory
**Noun**

A set of [_theory rules_](#theory-rule) that defines how [_outlines_](#outline) should map to [_translations_](#translation).

- Theories usually come with [_dictionaries_](#ditionaries), which are usually the theory author's best attempt to follow their [_theory rules_](#theory-rule).

## Conflict
**Noun**

An [_outline_](#outline) that has multiple valid [_translations_](#translation) according to your [_theories_](#theory).

- There are many different kinds of conflicts that happen for different reasons.
