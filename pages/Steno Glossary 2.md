- [_Key_](#key)
- [_Chord_](#chord)

## Key
**Noun**

An individual key on a _steno machine_ or _layout_. Analogous to a key on a keyboard.

- In _raw steno notation_, keys are written as their "face letter", plus a dash `-` denoting which _bank_ they are in.
- For example, in the _WSI layout_, there are two keys with the "face letter" "`S`", those being the _initial_ `S-` key, and the _final_ `-S` key. Notice the dash at the start and end of the key.

## Chord
**Noun**

A set, or group, of [_keys_](#key). Chords may denote a sound, letter, affix, or any other part of a _translation_.

- Chords can be combined to form _strokes_.
- The difference between a chord and a _stroke_ can often be subtle. See [[Chords vs. Strokes]].

**Verb**

Pressing down all the [_keys_](#key) that make up a chord on a _steno machine_.

- Often used interchangeably with the verb _stroke_.
