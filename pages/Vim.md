[[Home|I]] use Neovim as my [[Programming Languages|Code]] [[Code Editors|Editor]] to write [[Lisp|Lisp]], mostly [[Clojure|Clojure]].

I'm configuring it in [[Fennel|Fennel]] - I have an absolutely abhorrent self-hosted config that compiles and then overrides itself via regex, I have no idea don't ask.

I do plan on rewriting my config, I'll put it here when I do. I've been wanting to do it from-scratch for a while, but I would have to fill in the void of parinfer, conjure, completions, a file manager, and undotree...

I love Vim, but I definitely have some grievances; I've been designing [[Chalsed|Chalsed]], which addresses these.
