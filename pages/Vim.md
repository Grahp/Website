[[Home|I]] use Neovim as my [[Code Editors|Code Editor]] to write [[Lisp|Lisp]], mostly [[Clojure|Clojure]].

I'm configuring it in [[Fennel|Fennel]] - I have an absolutely abhorrent self-hosted config that compiles and then overrides itself via regex, I have no idea don't ask.

I'm sure if [[Faddle|Faddle]] ever becomes usable, I'll rewrite my config in it.

I love Vim, but I definitely have some grievances; I've been designing [[Chalsed|Chalsed]], which addresses these.
