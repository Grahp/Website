You can contact [[Home|me]] via email at `hello@grahp.dev`.

Feel free to reach out.

I'm [[Grahp|`@grahp`]] everywhere :)

I have some old repos on Microsoft Github that people still use, so I can't get rid of them.

I'm currently hosting [[Programming Languages|code]] on Codeberg until I set up a git server ([https://codeberg.org/Grahp](https://codeberg.org/Grahp)).
