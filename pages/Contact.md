You can contact [[Home|me]] via email at `grahp@grahp.dev`.

Feel free to reach out.

I'm `@grahp` everywhere :)

I have some old repos on Github that people still use, so I can't get rid of them :/

I'll be on codeberg for the foreseeable future ([https://codeberg.org/Grahp](https://codeberg.org/Grahp)). If I ever set up a [[Open Source|git server]], I'll probably use that instead.
