You can contact [[Home|me]] via email at `grahp@grahp.dev`.

Feel free to reach out.

I'm [[Grahp|`@grahp`]] everywhere :)

I have some old repos on Github that people still use, so I can't get rid of them.

I'm currently hosting [[Programming Languages|code]] on Codeberg until I set up my own [[Open Source|git server]] ([https://codeberg.org/Grahp](https://codeberg.org/Grahp)).
