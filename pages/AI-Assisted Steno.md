Why [[Home|I]] don't have high hopes for the use of AI in [[Steno|steno]]:

1. Realtime shorthand is so complex because of the inherent difficulty in translating a shorthand into English in real time (see [[Theory in Practice]]).
2. The goal in using AI is to allow steno to be more imprecise, which is probably not a good thing. We should be making simpler theories, not relying on AI to fix what's wrong with our theories.
3. Context-dependent shorthand is very commonly dependent on not just what has been written, but what the next few words are. A realtime system cannot depend on what _will_ be written later.
4. There is very little guarantee that a system like this could work with any amount of accuracy, especially as context dwindles. What happens when you write a single homophonic word in response to something? How is the AI supposed to know which spelling you intented? AI doesn't really solve much of the complexity inherent to realtime steno, it only adds more.

I don't think the percieved benefit of allowing realtime steno to be more imprecise is worth the inherent complexity that comes along with doing so.
