title: Leaving Minestom

Minestom is great. I just don't like it.

It's pretty hard to make something like a minecraft server, which requires a lot of communication, without a considerable interface. In the case of minestom, i do not like this interface.

- Mutable Player classes, Instance, etc.

At the end of the day, [[Clojure|it's still a large java project]], and I don't want to work with it.

I found myself reimplementing many features of minestom to make them more bearable (players, items), which is a clear sign to me that I should just go a level down.

## Alternatives
