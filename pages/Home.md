Hello, I'm [[Grahp|Grahp]]!

I'm a software developer from The Internetâ„¢, currently [[Code Editors|writing]] a [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft server]] [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from scratch]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]] called [[Bowmap|Bowmap]].

I'm designing [[Pinchord|Pinchord]], a [[Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theory]], and I have a bunch of [[Steno|steno resources]] :)

A few other random interests of mine: [[Programming Languages]], [[Code Editors]], [[Music]].

You can [[Contact]] me via email at `grahp@grahp.dev`.

I'm [[Open Source|hosting code]] on Codeberg for the time being ([https://codeberg.org/grahp](https://codeberg.org/grahp)). I'm too lazy to set up a git server right now.

All links are probably [[404|permalinks]]. They're also all [[How to Take Notes|internal links]] unless they start with "https://", so you can click around without fear!
