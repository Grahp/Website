Hello this is my website!

I'm making [[Bowmap|Bowmap]], a [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from-scratch]] MMORPG Minecraft server written in [[Clojure|Clojure]].

I'm learning to type on a [[Delusional|20 key keyboard]] :o

I'm also interested in [[Lisp|Lisps]], code editors, [[Delusional|keyboards]], [[Music]], pixel art, game design, and personal wiki mazes I guess.

I primarily write in [[Clojure|Clojure]]! I have used other languages but don't like any of them. I use some other lisps like [[Fennel|Fennel]] from time to time :p

You may find some of my [[Steno|Steno]] resources useful or interesting. I plan on better organizing my thoughts at some point in the future.

You can contact me via email at `grahp@grahp.dev`. Or like message me on Discord (I'm `@grahp` everywhere) and I'm probably more likely to see it because it makes a little noise.

You can also find me on Github, begrudgingly, for the time being. ([https://github.com/Grahp](https://github.com/Grahp)). Some day I will set up my own git server because fuck github.

You should link here ([https://grahp.dev](https://grahp.dev)) if you want a permanent link to me for whatever reason.


All link are permalinks.
