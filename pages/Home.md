Hello, I'm [[Grahp|Grahp]]!

I'm a software developer from The Internetâ„¢, currently [[Code Editors|writing]] a [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft Server]] [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from scratch]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]] called [[Bowmap|Bowmap]].

I'm designing [[Pinchord|Pinchord]], a [[Steno|Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theory]], and I have a bunch of [[Steno|Steno resources]] :)

A few other random interests of mine: [[Programming Languages]], [[Code Editors]], [[Music]].

You can [[Contact]] me via email at `grahp@grahp.dev`. Or like message me on Discord (I'm `@grahp` everywhere) and I'm probably more likely to see it because it makes a little noise.

All links are probably [[404|permalinks]].
