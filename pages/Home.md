Hello this is my website! You can find reading and tarballs here (I don't have a git server quite yet).

I'm making [[Bowmap|Bowmap]], a [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from-scratch]] MMORPG Minecraft server written in [[Clojure|Clojure]].

I'm learning to type on a [[Delusional|20 key keyboard]] :o

I'm also interested in [[Lisp|Lisps]], code editors, [[Delusional|keyboards]], [[Music]], pixel art, game design, and personal wiki mazes I guess.

I primarily write in [[Clojure|Clojure]]! I have used other languages but don't like any of them. I use some other lisps like [[Fennel|Fennel]] from time to time :p

You may find some of my [[Steno|Steno]] resources useful or interesting. I plan on better organizing my thoughts at some point in the future.

You can contact me via email at `grahp@grahp.dev`. Or like message me on Discord (I'm `@grahp` everywhere) and I'm probably more likely to see it because it makes a little noise.

All link are permalinks.
