Hello, I'm Grahp!

This is a test just ignore this <a href="Steno.md" Steno>

This is my website :p

I'm a software developer from The Internet™, currently working on a couple things:

[[Bowmap|Bowmap]] is an MMORPG [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft server]] written [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from scratch]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]].

I've been working on it for like 3 years, but you can see where I am on the latest attempt on the [[Bowmap Progress|Progress page]].

See the [[Steno|Steno]] page for links to all the other pages I've made about steno :p

There are some good reads there. And there's also... Uh...

You can [[Contact]] me via email at `hello@grahp.dev`.

All links are [[404|permalinks]] and they're [[How to Take Notes|internal links]] (unless they start with "https://"), so you can click around without fear!
