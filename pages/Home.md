Hello this is my website!

- Making [[Bowmap|Bowmap]], a from-scratch MMORPG Minecraft server written in [[Clojure|Clojure]]
- Learning to type on a 20 key keyboard :o
- Moderately interested in programming languages, code editors, keyboards, music, pixel art, game design, and personal wiki mazes I guess
- I write primarily write in [[Clojure|Clojure]]! I have used other languages but don't like any of them. I use some other lisps like [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/) from time to time :p

You may find some of my [[Steno|Steno]] resources useful or interesting. I plan on better organizing my thoughts at some point in the future.

You can contact me via email at `grahp@grahp.dev`.

You can also find me on Github, begrudgingly, for the time being. ([https://github.com/Grahp](https://github.com/Grahp)). Some day I will set up my own git server because fuck github.
You should link here ([https://grahp.dev](https://grahp.dev)) if you want a permanent link to me for whatever reason.


All link are permalinks.
