Hello, I'm Grahp!

This is [[Website|my website]] :p

I'm a software developer from The Internet™, currently working on a couple things:

## Bowmap

[[Bowmap|Bowmap]] is an MMORPG [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft server]] written [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from scratch]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]].

I've been working on it for a while - you can see where I'm at currently on the [[Bowmap Progress|Bowmap Progress]] page.

## Steno

A bunch of _[[Steno|Machine Stenography]]_ resources, but notably a "chorded typing" system called [[Pinchord|Pinchord]] that I'm in the process of [[Theory in Practice|designing]] and [[Pinchord Progress|learning]]!

## Faddle

[[Faddle|Faddle]] is a [[Lisp|Lisp]] on Lua designed to harness the power of Lua, Lisp, and avoiding some of the pitfalls of both. A more applied [[Fennel|Fennel]], perhaps.

Still just designing it, but maybe it'll release some day.

You can [[Contact]] me via email at `hello@grahp.dev`. Or any other name... They all work, `grahp@grahp.dev` just looks kinda weird ._.

Soon™ I will set up a git server here

All links are [[404|permalinks]] and they're [[Note Taking|internal links]] (unless they start with "https://"), so you can click around without fear!

No analytics or tracking or anything, so if you have any thoughts, [[Contact|send me an email]] :p

You could probably guess my feelings about webrings from everything else here, so:

- [https://oxey.dev](https://oxey.dev)
- Now there is a second / third :p

Hope you enjoy your stay :)
