Hello, this is my website! You can find reading and tarballs here (I don't have a [[Open Source|git server]] quite yet).

I'm making [[Bowmap|Bowmap]], a [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from-scratch]] MMORPG [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft server]] [[Code Editors|written]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]].

You may find my [[Steno|Steno]] resources useful or interesting :)

I primarily [[Code Editors|write]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]] (with [[Vim|Vim]])! I have used [[Programming Languages|other languages]] but don't like any of them. I use some other [[Lisp|Lisps]] like [[Fennel|Fennel]].

I'm also interested in [[Code Editors]], [[Delusional|keyboards]], [[Music]], [[Bowmap|game design]], and digital gardens I guess.


You can [[Contact]] me via email at `grahp@grahp.dev`. Or like message me on Discord (I'm `@grahp` everywhere) and I'm probably more likely to see it because it makes a little noise.

All links are probably [[404|permalinks]].
