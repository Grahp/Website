Building [[Quartz|Quartz]], a [[Steno]] programmatic dictionary manager, and using it to build a theory called [[Onyx|Onyx]], and [[Bowmap|Bowmap]], a [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from-scratch MMORPG Minecraft server]] written in [[Clojure|Clojure]].

Currently learning [[Steno]], hoping to completely replace my qwerty (dvorak) keyboard.
