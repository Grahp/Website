An [[Steno|Steno]] uberdictionary is a collection of [[Steno Glossary#Translation|translations]] with context about their pronunciations, orthography, origin, and other pertinent attributes.

With an uberdictionary, you can write context for translations once, and every single [[Steno Glossary Old#Theory|theory]] that uses the uberdictionary can use those translations without having to add them to their dictionary manually.

If you're using a [[Generated Programmatic Dictionaries|rule-based generated dictionary]], you get new [[Steno Glossary Old#Entry|entries]] completely for free!

Theories should be able to choose what translations they support, and build rules around them without immense effort.

This was an important concept in [[Quartz]].
