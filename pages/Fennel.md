[[Lisp|Lisp]] for [[Lua|Lua]] :p

Website: [https://fennel-lang.org](https://fennel-lang.org)

It's a surprisingly interesting language for what is pretty much just a syntax abstraction over Lua. Though in all fairness, Lua is a surprisingly interesting language itself.

It's not really homoiconic though, which is sad :( and hurts macros, as you might imagine :(

Homoiconicity is a spectrum, Fennel is definitely on the edge of being a Lisp or not. It also primarily compiles to Lua source and lives in that world.

[[Home|I]] am currently [[Code Editors|writing]] a Lisp for Lua called [[Faddle|Faddle]] which is somewhat inspired by Fennel.

My real "problems" with Fennel is that it doesn't solve my problems with Lua, nor does it try to.
