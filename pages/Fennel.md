[[Lisp|Lisp]] for Lua that [[Home|I]] felt like talking about for whatever reason.

Website: [https://fennel-lang.org](https://fennel-lang.org)

It's a surprisingly interesting language for what is pretty much just a syntax abstraction over Lua. Though in all fairness, Lua is a surprisingly interesting language itself.

It's not really homoiconic though, which is sad :( and hurts macros, as you might imagine :(

Homoiconicity is a spectrum, Fennel is definitely on the edge of being a Lisp or not. It also primarily compiles to Lua source and lives in that world.

My real "problems" with Fennel is that it doesn't solve my problems with Lua, nor does it try to.
