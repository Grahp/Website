Disclaimer: This page is part of the [[Onyx Spec|Onyx Spec]], meaning it may be out of date and/or incomplete.

[[Onyx|Onyx]] is a phonetic [[Steno|Steno]] [[Steno Glossary Old#Theory|Theory]].

Key ideas:
- Thoroughly phonetic, minimal orthography for conflict resolution only
- Very consistent
- Still short
- Extensible to user briefing

I like the Phoenix philosophy, but there is always concern with speed. I think you can get that consistency while remaining quite short.

## Disclaimer

Onyx is an old theory that [[Home|I]] no longer use. I ended up moving to a fully orthographic theory, [[Pinchord|Pinchord]]. However, I think there are some cool ideas here if anyone is interested in them.

Bear with me as I try to document something I haven't used in months :D
