Pronounced _KAL-SED_ ([[Pinchord|/kælsɛd/]])

The _[[Lisp|Lisp]]_ editor!

Just something [[Home|I've]] been thinking about for a while.

I'm a [[Vim|vimmer]], but I have my grievances, especially when it comes to editing [[Lisp|Lisp]].

## Thoughts

- Libraries over Plugins
- Dynamic over Static
- Foundation over Extension
- GUI over Terminal
- Code over Text
- Expressions over Characters

(Sorry for the half-baked page lol)
