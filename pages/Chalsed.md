The _[[Lisp|Lisp]]_ [[Code Editors|Editor]].

Just something [[Home|I've]] been thinking about for a while.

I'm a vimmer, but I have my grievances, especially when it comes to [[Lisp|Lisp]].

Vim is pretty antiquated, and I don't like the emphasis on plugins in Neovim.

I imagine an editor that isn't text based but _code_ based (or rather collection based, but those are the same thing in Lisp). This is my real problem with every editor I've ever used, they're all text editors through and through, and there's no amount of extension that can change that.
