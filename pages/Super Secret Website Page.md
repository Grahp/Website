title: Super Secret Website Page

[[Home|I]] hate when websites have pages about themselves, so I made this one a secret! So congrats for finding it.

## Todo

- Make my own SSG in [[Clojure|Clojure]] so I have more control over things (see below)
- Rewrite SPA logic in Clojurescript
- Cache pages on link hover?
- A git server on this bare domain with some kind of file tree somewhere...
- Images can be wider than the page content (especially on mobile)!
- Click on images to get a larger view?

### Future Ideas

Things I'd like to be able to do once I rewrite the website myself in [[Clojure|Clojure]]:
- Bundle all the characters used in a given page
- Bundle only the CSS actually needed
- Minify HTML, CSS, and JS
