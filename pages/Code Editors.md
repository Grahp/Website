[[Home|I've]] been thinking about [[Programming Languages|code]] editors for a while.

I've been designing an editor called [[Chalsed|Chalsed]]. There are some interesting ideas there.

For [[Steno]], there's [[Coding with Steno|Coding with Steno]]

I currently use [[Vim|Neovim]] and am not particularly satisfied.
