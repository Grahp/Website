## Key
**Noun**

An individual key on a _steno machine_ or _layout_. Analogous to a key on a keyboard.

- Multiple keys may share the same _label_, with a dash (-) denoting what _bank_ the key is in. For example, in the _WSI layout_, there are two keys _labeled_ '`S`': the _initial_ `S-` key, and the _final_ `-S` key. Notice the dash at the start and end of the key.

## Chord
**Noun**

A set, or group, of [_keys_](#key). Chords may denote a sound, letter, affix, or any other part of a _translation_.

- Chords can be combined to form [_strokes_](#stroke).
- The difference between a chord and a [_stroke_](#stroke) can often be subtle. See [[Chords vs Strokes|Chords vs. Strokes]].
- An example chord is `TPH-`, which _translates_ to the _initial_ "n" sound (/n/).

**Verb**

Pressing down all the [_keys_](#key) that make up a chord on a _steno machine_.

- "Chording" is a term outside of _steno_, which means "pressing multiple [_keys_](#key) together at once", rather than one at a time.
- Often used interchangeably with the verb [_stroke_](#stroke).

## Stroke
**Noun**

A set, or group, or [_keys_](#key) pressed together simultaneously.

- If that sounds like what a [_chord_](#chord) is, that's because [_chords_](#chord) and strokes are very similar. They are both sets of [_keys_](#key). When you press down a set of [_keys_](#key) simultaneously, that is a stroke. A [_chord_](#chord) is something you can use to build strokes.
- A helpful way to think of it is that when you combine two [_chords_](#chord), you get a stroke, but when you combine two strokes, you get an [_outline_](#outline)
- For a full explanation of the difference between [_chords_](#chord) and strokes, see [[Chords vs Strokes|Chords vs. Strokes]].

**Verb**

Pressing down all the [_keys_](#key) that make up a stroke on a _steno machine_.

- Often used interchangeably with the verb [_chord_](#chord).

## Outline
**Noun**

One or more [_strokes_](#stroke) [_chorded_](#chord), or pressed, in sequence.

## Translation
**Noun**

A word, phrase, part of a word or phase, sound, affix, command, punctuation, or any other output.

**Verb**

To "translate". The translation that an [_outline_](#outline) maps to is referred to as its "translation".

- For example, the [_outline_](#outline) `KAT` translates to "cat".

## Entry
**Noun**

An entry, or [_dictionary_](#dictionary) entry, is a mapping between an [_outline_](#outline) and a [_translation_](#translation).

- For example, the [_outline_](#outline) `HOT/TKOG` might map to the [_translation_](#translation) "hotdog".

## Dictionary
**Noun**

A set of [_outlines_](#outline) with mappings to [_translations_](#translation). Dictionaries are made up of dictionary [_entries_](#entry).

## Lookup
**Noun**

The process of "looking up" a [_translation_](#translation) in a [_dictionary_](#dictionary).

## Reverse Lookup
**Noun**

The process of "looking up" the [_outlines_](#outlines) that map to a given [_translation_](#translation) in a [_dictionary_](#dictionary).

- Called "reverse lookup" as it is the opposite of regular [_lookup_](#lookup).

## Programmatic
**Adjective**

A _dictionary_ being programmatic means that it [_translates_](#translation) [_outlines_](#outline) as you _write_ them, rather having a pre-defined collection of [_entries_](#entry).

## Modal
**Adjective**

A _dictionary_ being modal means that it may contain different _entries_, and thus "do different things", depending on what "mode" you are in.

- Your current mode can change through a mode-switching _stroke_, based on _context_, or really for any other reason.

## Theory Rule
**Noun**

A "rule" defining some part of how [_outlines_](#outline) should be mapped to [_translations_](#translation).

## Theory
**Noun**

A set of [_theory rules_](#theory-rule) that defines how [_outlines_](#outline) should map to [_translations_](#translation).

- Theories usually come with [_dictionaries_](#ditionaries), which are usually the theory author's best attempt to follow their [_theory rules_](#theory-rule).

## Conflict
**Noun**

An [_outline_](#outline) that has multiple valid [_translations_](#translation) according to your [_theories_](#theory).

- There are many different kinds of conflicts that happen for different reasons.

## Word Boundary Conflict
**Noun**

A type of [_conflict_](#conflict) where it is unclear where [_outlines_](#outline) should start and stop given a sequence of [_strokes_](#stroke).

## Write-out
**Noun**

An [_outline_](#outline) that follows all [_theory rules_](#theory-rule), and isn't _shortened_ in any way.

## Brief
**Noun**

An "abbreviated" [_outline_](#outline), used to reduce the number of [_strokes_](#stroke) required to _write_ a [_translation_](#translation).

**Verb**

To "abbreviate" an [_outline_](#outline). To use a [_translation_](#translation)'s brief rather than its [_write-out_](#write-out).

## Mandatory
**Noun**

An [_outline_](#outline) with no [_write-out_](#write-out), and only [_briefs_](#brief).

**Adjective**

Having no [_writeouts_](#write-out), and only [_briefs_](#brief).

## Raw Steno
**Noun**

A notation for writing _keys_, _strokes_, _chords_, and _outlines_ in a more human-readable form.

- `-T` is a _key_ on the _final_ _bank_ of the _WSI Layout_.
- `KWR-` is a _chord_ in the _initial_ _bank_ of the _WSI Layout_.
- `KAT` is a _stroke_.
- `KEUT/KAT` is an _outline_.

## Steno Order
**Noun**

The order that the _keys_ of a _layout_ are written in with _raw steno_.

- Steno order is often used in a few ways by _theories_ to make it clear when you can do certain things.

## Layout
**Noun**

A set of [_keys_](#key) with _labels_, often grouped into _banks_, often with a defined _steno order_, that can be grouped into [_chords_](#chord).

- The most common, and "standard" steno layout is the _WSI Layout_.

## WSI Layout
**Noun**

The "standard" steno [_layout_](#layout).

## Extended Stenotype Layout
**Noun**

An "extended" version of the [_WSI layout_](#wsi-layout) featuring 2 more [_keys_](#key), `^` and `+`.

## Bank
**Noun**

A logical group of [_keys_](#key) on a [_layout_](#layout), used to organize [_keys_](#key) based on their position.

- The [_WSI layout_](#wsi-layout) has 3 banks: the _initial_, _vowel_, and _final_ banks.

## Initial
**Noun**

The _bank_ with the "initial" or "starting" sound or spelling of a word.

Can also refer to a _key_, _chord_, _stroke_, or _outline_ in the initial _bank_

- E.g. the "c" in "cat"
- Sometimes called the "starter" bank.

**Adjective**

A _key_, _chord_, _stroke_, or _outline_ in the initial _bank_.

## Vowel
**Noun**

The _bank_ with the vowel sound or spelling of a word.

Less commonly, can also refer to a _key_, _chord_, _stroke_, or _outline_ in the vowel _bank_

- E.g. the "a" in "cat"

**Adjective**

A _key_, _chord_, _stroke_, or _outline_ in the vowel _bank_.

## Final
**Noun**

The _bank_ with the vowel sound or spelling of a word.

Can also refer to a _key_, _chord_, _stroke_, or _outline_ in the final _bank_

- E.g. the "t" in "cat"
- Sometimes called the "ender" bank (no relation to [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft]] :p).

**Adjective**

A _key_, _chord_, _stroke_, or _outline_ in the final _bank_.

## Skeleton
**Noun**

A _stroke_ that is a skeleton.

**Adjective**

A skeleton _stroke_ has no _keys_ in the _vowel_ _bank_

## Fingerspelling
**Noun**

A method of _writing_ words letter-by-letter using a fingerspelling theory/dictionary.

**Adjective**

A theory/dictionary where words are _written_ letter-by-letter, allowing you to _write_ words that aren't in your _dictionary_

**Verb**

The act of _writing_ with a fingerspelling _theory_/_dictionary_

## Orthospelling
**Noun**

A method of _writing_ words multiple letters at a time using an orthospelling _theory_/_dictionary_.

**Adjective**

An orthospelling [_theory_](#theory)/[_dictionary_](#dictionary) is fully _orthographic_. It's like [_fingerspelling_](#fingerspelling), but uses the whole [_layout_](#layout), or more of the [_layout_](#layout) than just one [_fingerspelling_](#fingerspelling) [_bank_](#bank).

An _orthographic_ theory/dictionary where words are written multiple letters at a time.

**Verb**

The act of _writing_ using an orthospelling [_theory_](#theory) or [_dictionary_](#dictionary).

## Dedicated
**Adjective**

A dedicated [_key_](#key), [_chord_](#chord), [_stroke_](#stroke), or [_outline_](#outline) is reserved for a specific purpose and cannot be used for anything else.
