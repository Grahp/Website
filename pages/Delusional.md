[[Home|My]] 18 key keyboard layout, made by `@5quidwyrm` ([https://github.com/5quiwyrm](https://github.com/5quiwyrm)).

After like a year of trying, I gave up on learning [[Steno|Steno]], but I still had a 26 key steno keyboard (The Starboard: [https://stenography.store](https://stenography.store)) laying around that I wanted to use to [[Typing|type]].

I've never really liked lateral/horizontal of my index and pinky fingers, so I removed those keys. This requires using a thumb key for one letter (r), and a chord for another (q).

It uses a [[Chorded Home Row|Chorded home row]].

Some day I'll probably make a real 18 key keyboard so it can be a bit smaller than the Starb.
