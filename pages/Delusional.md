[[Home|My]] 18 key keyboard layout, made by `@5quidwyrm` ([https://github.com/5quiwyrm](https://github.com/5quiwyrm)).

- Put the layout here!

Basically I had a 26 key [[Steno|Steno]] keyboard, the Starboard ([https://www.stenography.store](https://www.stenography.store)), and I wanted to use it to [[Typing|type]] :p (Turns out steno was too hard for me)

Just ended up not needing all of the keys.

Some day I'll probably make a real 18 key keyboard so it can be a bit smaller than the Starb.
