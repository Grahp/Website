[[Home|My]] 18 key keyboard layout, made by `@5quidwyrm` ([https://github.com/5quiwyrm](https://github.com/5quiwyrm)).

After trying to use [[Steno|Steno]] for like 9 months and eventually giving up, I still wanted to use my Steno keyboard, the Starboard ([https://stenography.store](https://stenography.store)) to [[Typing|type]]. Didn't end up using all 26 of the keys :p

Some day I'll probably make a real 18 key keyboard so it can be a bit smaller than the Starb.
