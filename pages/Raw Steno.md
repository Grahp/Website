[[Home|My]] observation of how people write [[Steno Glossary Old#Raw Steno|Raw Steno]].

In progress, of course.

## Keys

[[Steno Glossary Old#Key|Keys]] should always include a `-` for their [[Steno Glossary Old#Bank|bank]] when banks are free to reuse keys, as they are in [[Steno Glossary Old#WSI Layout|WSI]].

`K-` `T-` `-T`

## Chords/Strokes

[[Chords vs Strokes|Chords and Strokes]] do not need a `-` if they are [[Steno Glossary Old#Starter|Initials]]

Suffix strokes start with `/`, such as `/-S`.

Prefix strokes end with `/`, such as `OPB/`.

Strokes that are both prefixes and suffixes, such as with the translation `{^-to-^}`, may both start and end with `/`, such as `/TO*/`, but they will usually have no `/`s, and instead be written as `TO*`

I think all strokes should end with `/`, but they usually don't.

`KWR`
`TKOG`
`KAT/`

### Outlines

Strokes are delimited by `/`. You might also see strokes delimited by space (` `) when you're not talking about specific outlines, but just a bunch of strokes.

`HOT/TKO*G`
`-T KWEUBG PWROUPB TPOBGS`

- Origin
- Layouts
- Mapping (of steno units to other units)
	-  '`outline` → "translation"'
	-  '"translation" → "translation"' meaning the outline that _would_ map to the first translation maps to the second translation
	-  'steno pattern ⇒ rule'
	- Things an outline can map to:
		- Orthographic Sequences
		- Phonetic or Phonemic units
		    - Syntax with these
- Lowercase words for placeholders
- Regex
- Theory Rules
