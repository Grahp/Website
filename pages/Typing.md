[[Home|I]]'m currently learning to type on an [[Delusional|18 key keyboard]]!

I've been learning to type since I was like 12. I've gotten up to ~160wpm with dvorak.

For a while, I was trying to learn to "type" with [[Steno]], but it ended up being too hard for me. I did learn a lot in that time, though.

I write, chat, and code (in [[Clojure|Clojure]]), all of which I'm currently doing in qwerty, but would like to be using my 18 key keyboard for :)
