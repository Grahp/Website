[[Home|I'm]] currently learning to type on an [[Delusional|18 key keyboard]]!

I've been learning to type since I was like 12. I've gotten up to ~160wpm with dvorak.

For a while, I was trying to learn to "type" with [[Steno]], but it ended up being too hard for me. Made a few theories ([[Onyx]] and [[Pinchord]]) in that time, and I learned a lot.

I write, chat, and [[Code Editors|code]] (in [[Clojure|Clojure]]), all of which I'm currently doing in qwerty, but would like to be using my [[Delusional|18 key keyboard]] for :)

I'm practicing every day on Monkeytype ([https://monkeytype.com/profile/Grahp2](https://monkeytype.com/profile/Grahp2)).
