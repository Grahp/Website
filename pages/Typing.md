[[Home|I've]] been learning to type since I was like 12, getting up to ~160wpm with dvorak.

For the past year or so, I've been learning [[Steno]], most of that time spent working on [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theories]] and not actually practicing...

I write, chat, and [[Code Editors|code]] (in [[Clojure|Clojure]]), all of which I'm currently doing with qwerty, but would eventually like to be using [[Steno]].
