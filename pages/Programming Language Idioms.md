I love [[Clojure]], but more and more I'm realizing that what makes clojure special is not what you can do in clojure, anything you can do it clojure you could also do in java, but the idioms.

Clojure is a very opinionated language.

I've been writing code in other languages, and, besides a few small differences, it's the EXACT same code I would write in clojure.

- When you get into other people's code, it's awful.
- Clojure forces you to write code in a certain way, where you don't have to in less opinionated languages.
