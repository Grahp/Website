Pinchord (pronounced _PIN-CHORD_) is an [[Steno Glossary#Orthographic|orthographic]] [[Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theory]] designed to be much simpler and easier to learn and master than traditional steno.

To start using Pinchord, see [[Setting up Pinchord|Setting up Pinchord]].

[[Home|I'm]] currently learning Pinchord, but practice is hard.

## Rationale

Steno theories today are extremely complex, which makes them much harder to learn and master.

I'm writing a whole page about theory complexity ([[Theory in Practice|Theory in Practice]]), but for now, this is what has come of that.

I wanted a very simple orthographic steno theory that I can use to [[Coding with Steno|code]], write, and control my computer. This is my best attempt at that.

I think [[Steno Glossary#Phonetic|phonetic]] steno makes a lot of sense when transcribing spoken word, but does not suit my needs well.

## Trade-offs

### Speling

Pinchord is [[Steno Glossary#Orthographic|orthographic]], meaning words are [[Steno Glossary#Writing|written]] based on how they are spelled, rather than how they sound. If you mostly use steno to write what you _hear_, this is definitely a mismatch.

If spelling is not your strong suit, you may also want to look at a [[Steno Glossary#Phonetic|phonetic]] theory.

### Ergonomics and Comfort

Fully orthographic theories are potentially less ergonomic than phonetic theories since there are more ways a word could be spelled than ways it could sound, and because sounds can be cleverly [[Steno Glossary#Merge|merged]] in ways that do not cause [[Steno Glossary#Conflict|conflicts]]. All of this means you need more [[Steno Glossary#Key|keys]], which means you need to move your fingers more in order to write most words. While Pinchord is still more ergonomic than any other alternative text input method, phonetic steno beats it out at least slightly.

[[Home|I]] can say that I don't find Pinchord to be uncomfortable in any way.

### Speed

An [[Steno Glossary#Orthospelling|orthospelling]] theory may not be able to reach the same speeds as a phonetic theory.

While no one has reached professional speeds using an orthospelling theory, I do believe there is nothing stopping you from doing so.

Most words take the exact same number of [[Steno Glossary#Stroke|strokes]] as a [[Steno Glossary#Write-out|write-out]] in most phonetic theories. Beyond that, just like phonetic theories, you can [[Steno Glossary#Brief|brief]] to your hearts content, and get as fast as you'd like.

I do not believe speed will be any more of a barrier in Pinchord until you are beyond 200wpm, but again, nobody has gotten this fast (yet).

## Benefits

### Conflicts

Pinchord does not have conflicts.

I'm not sure if I could really put into words the importance of this point, so I won't even bother.

### Ease of Learning

I believe that Pinchord is handily the easiest theory to learn and reach your qwerty typing speed.

Learning Pinchord is much more comparable to learning an alternate keyboard layout. Phonetic theories impose a ludicrous amount of complexity that a fully orthographic theory simply does not have.

Once you know all the [[Steno Glossary#Chord|chords]] (there are maybe 100?), there is literally nothing else to learn.

Those ~100 chord encompass everything* you would ever need in order to use a computer.

Getting fast with those chords is obviously a different story.

## Obscure words

Pinchord has the capability to write any word that could ever possible exist.
