Pinchord is a chorded typing system/[[Steno Glossary#Orthospelling|orthospelling]] [[Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theory]] designed to harness the power of phonetic steno for normal(ish) people.

For the steno crowd, see [[Why Orthospelling|Why Orthospelling]].

## Rationale

- Steno is awesome. The speed and ergonomics are unmatched. Chording is just a good idea, you can't deny that
- Traditional phonetic steno is extremely difficult to learn
- Phonetic steno is optimized for _court reporting_. I am not a court reporter, I'm a programmer and yapper

## Layout

Note that Pinchord is in development and that this graphic is missing a few things (notably `h` and `q` :p)
