Pinchord is a Full English [[Steno Glossary#Orthospelling|Orthospelling]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|Theory]] designed to remove much of the complexity of [[Steno|Steno]].

[[Home|I]] eventually gave up on learning steno before completing this, but the dictionary and layouts are still good. You can find them on [https://github.com/Grahp/Pinchord](https://github.com/Grahp/Pinchord).

This theory evolved from [[Onyx|Onyx]], so you may see some stuff refer to "Onyx", but Onyx is a different thing.

To start using Pinchord, see [[Setting up Pinchord|Setting up Pinchord]].

## Tradeoffs

### Speling

Pinchord is orthographic, meaning words are constructed based on how they are spelled, rather than how they sound. If your use of steno mainly involves transcribing spoken word, this is certainly a mismatch, and you should use a phonetic theory.

If spelling is not your strong suit, you may also want to look at a phonetic theory.

### Ergonomics and Comfort

Fully orthographic theories are potentially less ergonomic than phonetic theories. This is because there are a lot more sequences of letters than there are sounds, and because sounds can be cleverly combined in ways that do not cause conflicts. All of this means you need more keys, which means you need to move your fingers more in order to write most words. While Pinchord is still more ergonomic than any other alternative text input method, phonetic steno beats it out at least slightly.

I can say that I don't find Pinchord to be uncomfortable in any way.

### Speed

An orthospelling theory may not be able to reach the same speeds as a phonetic theory.

While no one has reached professional speeds using an orthospelling theory, I do believe there is nothing stopping you from doing so.

Most words take the exact same number of strokes as a writeout in most phonetic theories. Beyond that, just like phonetic theories, you can brief to your hearts content, and get as fast as you'd like.

I do not believe speed will be any more of a barrier in Pinchord until you are beyond 200wpm, but again, nobody has gotten this fast (yet).

## Benefits

### Conflicts

Pinchord does not have conflicts.

I'm not sure if I could really put into words the importance of this point, so I won't even bother.

### Ease of Learning

I believe that Pinchord is handily the easiest theory to learn and reach your qwerty typing speed.

Learning Pinchord is much more comparable to learning an alternate keyboard layout. Phonetic theories impose a ludicrous amount of complexity that a fully orthographic theory simply does not have.

Once you know all the chords (there are maybe 100?), there is literally nothing else to learn.

Those ~100 chord encompass everything* you would ever need in order to use a computer.

Getting fast with those chords is obviously a different story.

## Obscure words

Pinchord has the capability to write any word that could ever possible exist.
