## Onyx Splitting

Every consecutive stroke after the first stroke of a multi-stroke outline is skeletonized.

This means that skeleton strokes may not be used for briefs, or otherwise.

Onyx splitting avoids all word boundary conflicts, and introduces remarkably few conflicts.

## Briefing

Arbitrary briefs are used very rarely in Onyx. I believe these are very personal, and shouldn't be dictated by your theory.
