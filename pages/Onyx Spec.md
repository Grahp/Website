[[Onyx|Onyx]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|Theory]] Specification.

Disclaimer: This page, and the rest of the Onyx Spec, may be out of date and/or incomplete. See [[Onyx Spec Archive|this notice]].

Onyx is an abandoned [[Steno Glossary#Phonetic|phonetic]] [[Steno|steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theory]] built around purity, consistency, and shortness.

Disclaimer: Onyx is an old theory that [[Home|I]] no longer use, and no [[Steno Glossary#Dictionary|dictionary]] was ever made. I ended up moving to a fully orthographic theory, [[Pinchord|Pinchord]]. However, I think there are some cool ideas here if anyone is interested in them.

Bear with me as I try to document something I haven't used in months :D

## Outline

Onyx is a (hopefully) accent-independent minimal phonetic steno theory for the [[Steno Glossary#WSI Layout|WSI]]/[[Steno Glossary#Extended Stenotype Layout|Extended Stenotype]] [[Steno Glossary#Layout|layouts]].

- [[Onyx Syllabic Splitting|Syllabic Splitting]]
- [[Onyx Mandatories|Mandatories]]
- Conflict resolution via orthography, `*`, etc.
