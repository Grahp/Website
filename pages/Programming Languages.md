[[Home|I]] like [[Lisp|Lisps]], particularly [[Clojure|Clojure]].

I've been thinking about programming languages cursorily pretty much since I started using them (I mean, who hasn't?). This hasn't manifested in much, other than a blank website for a language called [[Faddle|Faddle]].

I'd like to learn Haskell, but haven't :(

I've probably gotten too comfortable in my current ways. Haskell looks pretty cool, though it is still in somewhat of a similar world to [[Clojure|Clojure]].

And maybe see [[Coding With Steno|Coding with Steno]]? Or maybe don't.
