[[Home|I]] like [[Lisp|Lisps]], particularly [[Clojure|Clojure]].

I've been programming since I was like 12 or something. The earliest project I can find is from 2022 :p

I've been thinking about language design cursorily pretty much since I started programming (I mean, who hasn't?). This hasn't manifested in much, other than a blank website for a language called [[Faddle|Faddle]].

I worked on some languages that compile to Minecraft datapacks, Lua, the JVM, and probably more that I've forgotten about :p. Nothing really came of these either.

I'd like to learn Haskell, but haven't :(

I've probably gotten too comfortable in my current ways. Haskell looks pretty cool, though it is still in somewhat of a similar world to [[Clojure|Clojure]]. I'm sure there are most interesting languages that I should learn. I've tried a lot of languages out very briefly, but haven't given them a fair shot.

And maybe see [[Coding with Steno]]?

I [[Code Editors|write]] in [[Vim|Vim]], btw.
