Part of the [[Onyx Spec|Onyx spec]].

[[Onyx|Onyx]] uses a non-standard layout inspired by the TPSteno Layout (found at [https://github.com/StrawberryTurtle/TPSteno](https://github.com/StrawberryTurtle/TPSteno)).

You can find the layout at [https://github.com/Grahp/plover-onyx-Layout](https://github.com/Grahp/plover-onyx-Layout)

The layout strictly requires 18 keys: 2 for each finger, 1 for each pinky.

The recommended layout uses 23 keys, with a minimal 18 key layout and steno machine-compatible layout being provided as alternatives.
