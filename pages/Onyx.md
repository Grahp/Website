This is a high-level overview. For a more detailed breakdown of the rules of Onyx, see the [[Onyx Spec|Onyx spec]].

Onyx strives to be the simplest possible theory.

## Theory Complexities

What makes theories complex?

Onyx does not solve all of these, but they are interesting to think about.

### Conflicts

Conflicts are definitionally complex. Conflicts complect words together. They cause otherwise unrelated words to have an implicit relationship.
 
Word boundary conflicts complect every stroke with every other stroke surrounding it, as the meaning of a stroke can change depending on it's surroundings.

Word-affix conflicts, as the name suggests, complect words and affixes.

Proper noun conflicts complect normal words with proper nouns.

Homophones complect words that sound the same together.

### Mandatories

Mandatories complect a word with a brief (big nono).

### Theory Rules

Theory rules _can_ be complex. Theory rules can conflict with each other, complecting them. Rules can also complect outlines or translations with each other.

## Theory Goals

- _Simple_ core
- User-tailored pronunciation (via [[Quartz|Quartz]])
- Open for user [[Steno Glossary#Brief|briefing]]

## Beliefs

- Complexity is the root of all theory problems.
- Smaller theories are better. Smaller theories are easier to learn, easier to build, easier to understand, easier to maintain, easier to extend, easier to keep consistent, easier to document...
- Theories must still be extensible. An opinionated core and an extensible foundation are required.
- Theory dictionaries should be rule-based, not entry-based.

## Future Plans

- Dictionary (via [[Quartz|Quartz]])
- Learning resource for hobbyists
- Learning resource for beginners
