Onyx is...

Well I tend to reuse names a lot, but Onyx was 2 (now abandoned) [[Steno|Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|Theories]].

The first being my old phonetic theory loosely derived from [Lapwing](https://lapwing.aerick.ca/Home.html), probably go look at whatever [Harri](https://github.com/StenoHarri) is up to; and the second being what is now [[Pinchord]], so look there I guess.
