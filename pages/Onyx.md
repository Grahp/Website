Onyx is an abandoned [[Steno|Steno]] Phonetic[[Steno Glossary#Theory|Theory]] [[Home|I]] was making.

I've tried to organize the ideas I had at the time I was making this.

Onyx was derived from the Lapwing theory ([https://lapwing.aerick.ca/](https://lapwing.aerick.ca/)), a descendant of StenEd ([https://www.stenedsource.com/](https://www.stenedsource.com/))

You can check out the old [[Onyx Spec|Onyx spec]].

I also briefly used this name for an [[Steno Glossary#Orthospelling|orthospelling]] theory later named [[Pinchord|Pinchord]], so maybe check that out as well.
