WIP [[Steno|Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|Theory]].

See [[Onyx Spec|Onyx Spec]].

(This page is a bit outdated, I'll update it at some point)

My Theory Beliefs:
(See [[Quartz|Quartz]])
- Inconsistencies are annoying when learning. They are incredibly dangerous when you have to build on top of a shaky theory.
- Small theories are better.
- [[Steno Glossary#Brief|Briefs]] and [[Steno Glossary#Write-out|write-outs]] are equally important.

Onyx Goals:
- Consistency
- Minimality
- Provide a solid foundation for user briefing
- Brief [[Steno Glossary#Template|templates]]

## Theory Size

Smaller ~~theories~~ things are easier to learn, easier to build on, easier to understand, easier to maintain, easier to keep consistent, easier to document...

What impacts theory size?
- Number of [[Steno Glossary#Theory Rule|rules]]
- [[Steno Glossary#Mandatory|Mandatory outlines]]
- [[Steno Glossary#Arbitrary|Arbitrary Briefs]]

## Consistency

Inconsistencies propagate. Extending an inconsistent foundation is a mess.
