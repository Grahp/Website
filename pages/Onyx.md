WIP Phonetic [[Steno|Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|Theory]].

See [[Onyx Spec|Onyx Spec]].

## Goals

- **Simplicity and Consistency**
- Obvious, consistent [[Steno Glossary#Entry|entries]]
  - User-tailored pronunciations, and perfectly consistent phonetics (via [[Quartz|Quartz]])
  - Minimal mandatory orthography (candid and completely enumerated, via [[Quartz|Quartz]])
- Open for user [[Steno Glossary#Brief|briefing]]

## Beliefs

- Inconsistencies are annoying when learning. They are incredibly dangerous when you have to build on top of a shaky foundation.
- Inconsistencies propagate, FAST.
- Smaller theories are better. Smaller theories are easier to learn, easier to build, easier to understand, easier to maintain, easier to extend, easier to keep consistent, easier to document...

## Single-stroke Outlines

Single-stroke outlines (which are used for canonic single-syllable words) are consistent with their pronunciation.

- `KAT` -> cat
- `TPOEPB` -> phone
- `PHAOEPB` -> mean

Orthographic rules ("orthographic exceptions") are used when needed to avoid homophonic conflicts.

- `PHAEUPB` -> main
- `PHAEPB` -> mane

See the [[Onyx Spec|Onyx Spec]] for a full list of how symbolic units are constructed around chords, how conflict resolution and orthography are used, and more.

Conflicts are resolved via [[Steno Glossary#Theory Rule|**rules**]] before [[Steno Glossary#Mandatory|mandatory outlines]].

Most conflicts are resolved via [[Steno Glossary#Theory Rule|rules]] rather than [[Steno Glossary#Arbitrary|arbitrary briefs]] and [[Steno Glossary#Mandatory|mandatory outlines]].

> "Just one more rule."

## Multi-stroke Outlines

For multi-stroke outlines (which are used for canonic multi-syllable words), Onyx Splitting is used, meaning the vowel keys (`A`, `O`, `E`, and `U`) are dropped (not used) in all strokes after the first ("consecutive strokes") in multi-stroke outlines (the consecutive strokes are "skeletonized").

Take a word like "helmet". In Onyx, it's (only) outline is `HEL/PH-T`. Rather than `HEL/PHET` (orthographic) or `HEL/PHEUT` (phonetic), the vowel is dropped, and the unstressed vowel is implied.

What about a large word that you might not have ever seen before? Sound it out.

What about a compound word you might not have ever seen before? Just sound it out.

Take "international". I use the write-out `EU/TPH-R/TPH/SH/TPH-L`, which is exactly how I pronounce the word (i ner na shuh nl). Perhaps you say "in ter", or "in tuh", whatever your pronunciation, it is supported.

As for pros and cons, the downside of Onyx Splitting is that you can't use skeletons or the starter bank on it's own (strokes like `TPH`, and `TR-RB`, are not allowed).

The upside? You entirely remove word boundary conflicts.

I don't think people realize that word boundary conflicts are a **HUGE** deal. The mere presence of word boundary conflicts in a theory means that you can never really be certain that your outlines will even work at all! You haven't tried every combination of outlines with different surroundings.

Theories without word boundary conflicts are way simpler. Outlines exist completely on their own, and not complected with their surroundings.

As for conflicts Onyx Splitting creates, I believe I've found four, though it varies from person to person (documentation wip). For example, "relive" and "relieve" are not conflicts in my accent, as I pronounce the first vowel in "relive" as `AOE`, and the first vowel in "relieve" as `U`.

The lack of skeletons can make briefs more complex, as they're in the same space as normal entries, though this isn't a huge problem (briefs should be obvious, and skeletons are a cop-out, IMO).

Not having naked starters does suck though :/

I have found a lot more synergies with Onyx Splitting, though I've largely forgotten them (whoops!).

With Onyx splitting, you also don't need joiners, linkers, dedicated prefix and suffix outlines. It also makes squishing strokes down easier, templates galore.

## Briefing

Templated briefs are briefs built around theory rules. Templated briefs are largely the only briefs onyx will provide. I believe that arbitrary briefs are very personal, and shouldn't be dictated by your theory. If you want to use my arbitrary briefs, you're wrong.
