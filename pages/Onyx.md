WIP Phonetic [[Steno|Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|Theory]].

See [[Onyx Spec|Onyx Spec]].

## Goals

- **Simplicity, Minimality, Consistency**
- Obvious Entries
  - User-tailored pronunciations, and perfectly consistent phonetics (via Quartz)
  - Minimal mandatory orthography (candid and completely enumerated, via Quartz)
- Open for user briefing

## Beliefs

- Inconsistencies are annoying when learning. They are incredibly dangerous when you have to build on top of a shaky foundation. Inconsistencies propagate.
- Smaller theories are better. Smaller theories are easier to learn, easier to build, easier to understand, easier to maintain, easier to extend, easier to keep consistent, easier to document...

## Simple Outlines

Single stroke outlines are fairly straightforward. They are written how you pronounce them, unless they're not.

There are a few conflicts (It wasn't me, blame english), but they are candid and enumerated.

See [[Onyx Spec|Onyx Spec]] for a more in-depth view of the rules.

## Complex Outlines

For multi-stroke outlines, Onyx Splitting is used.

That means consecutive strokes in multi-stroke outlines are skeletonized.

Take a word like "helmet". In Onyx, it's (only) outline is `HEL/PH-T`. Rather than `HEL/PHET` (orthographic) or `HEL/PHEUT` (phonetic), the vowel is dropped.

What about a large word that you might not have ever seen before? Sound it out.

Take "internationalization". I use the write-out `EU/TPH-R/TPH/SH/TPH/L/STKPW-GS`, which is **exactly** how I pronounce the word. If you wanted, with very minimal effort, and remaining completely canon, you can split that into `+EUPBR/N/+SH-PBL/STKPW-GS`. Pretty cool stuff.

As for pros and cons, the downside of Onyx Splitting is that you can't use skeletons or the starter bank on it's own (no `TPH`, or `TR-RB`, et al.).

The upside? You entirely remove word boundary conflicts.

I don't think people realize that word boundary conflicts are a **HUGE** deal. The mere presence of word boundary conflicts in a theory means that you can never really be certain that your outlines will even work at all! You haven't tried every combination of outlines with different surroundings.

Theories without word boundary conflicts are way simpler. Outlines exist completely on their own, and not complected with their surroundings.

As for conflicts Onyx Splitting creates, I believe I've found four, though it varies from person to person (documentation wip). For example, "relive" and "relieve" are not conflicts in my accent, as I pronounce the first vowel in "relive" as `AOE`, and the first vowel in "relieve" as `U`.

The lack of skeletons can make briefs more complex, as they're in the same space as normal entries, though this isn't a huge problem (briefs should be obvious, and skeletons are a cop-out, IMO).

Not having naked starters does suck though :/

I have found a lot more synergies with Onyx Splitting, though I've largely forgotten them (whoops!).

With Onyx splitting, you also don't need joiners, linkers, dedicated prefix and suffix outlines. It also makes squishing strokes down easier, templates galore.

## Briefing

Templated briefs are briefs built around theory rules.
