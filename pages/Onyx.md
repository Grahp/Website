Onyx is a [[Steno Glossary#Phonetic|phonetic]] [[Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theory]] that [[Home|I]] was working on a while ago.

I have since moved on to [[Steno Glossary#Orthospelling|orthospelling]] with a theory called [[Pinchord|Pinchord]] (see [[Theory in Practice|Theory in Practice]]), but I've tried to organize the theory here so that anyone making a new phonetic theory can take inspiration.

I would encourage you to read through the [[Onyx Spec|Onyx spec]] if you're making a new phonetic theory. You should really read about as many theories as you can :p

Onyx was an attempt to make an extremely simple phonetic theory (again, see [[Theory in Practice|Theory in Practice]]) built around a few core ideas:

1. Fully phonetic
2. Extremely short
3. Zero* mandatories
4. Open to heavy briefing

Onyx is a loose derivation of Lapwing ([https://lapwing.aerick.ca/](https://lapwing.aerick.ca/))

You can read about the theory in the [[Onyx Spec|Onyx spec]].
