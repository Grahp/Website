Maximally Simple [[Steno|Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|Theory]].

This is an overview of the rationale behind and the expectations of Onyx. For a full specification of the theory, see the [[Onyx Spec|Onyx spec]].

## Rationale

Steno theories are far too complex.

- Why that's bad
- The tradeoff for speed
- How theories are complex
  - Phonetics, pronunciation
  - Conflicts
  - Mandatories
- What can be done about it
  - A lot of complexity can be avoided

## Beliefs

- Complexity is the root of all theory problems.
- Smaller theories are better. Smaller theories are easier to learn, easier to build, easier to understand, easier to maintain, easier to extend, easier to keep consistent, easier to document...
- Theories must still be extensible. An opinionated core and an extensible foundation are required.
- Theory dictionaries should be rule-based, not entry-based.

## Plans

- Continue theory design and specification
- Official dictionary (via [[Quartz|Quartz]])
- Learning resource for hobbyists
- Learning resource for beginners
