Faddle is a [[Lisp|Lisp]] (or Lisp-like [[Programming Languages|language]]) that [[Home|I'm]] working on. Not sure if anything will come of it.

It has a website: [https://faddle.org](https://faddle.org)

I'm not really sure that Faddle is a good name but that domain was available so I bought it immediately and now I guess that's what this thing is called...

I do love the name, so I'll definitely use it for _something_ :p.
