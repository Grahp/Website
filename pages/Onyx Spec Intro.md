Part of the [[Onyx Spec]].

## Rationale

- Phonetic, consistent theory

## Syntax

[[Steno Glossary#Raw Steno|Raw Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Outline|outlines]] are inside `Code Blocks`, such as `KAT`.

"[[Steno Glossary#Translation|Translations]]" are inside quotes, such as "cat".

[[Steno Glossary#Entry|Entries]] follow the format outline → translation, such as `KAT` → "cat"

## Badges

- ![Documented](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documented-blue?style=flat) means the section has been fully documented and should be up to date.
  - If a section does not have the documented badge, it's probably undocumented.
- ![Stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/Stable-green?style=flat) means the section has not been changed in a significant amount of time, and is unlikely to change in the future.
  - If a section does not have the stable badge, it's probably unstable.
