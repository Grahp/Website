_[[Steno Glossary#WSI Layout|Ward Stone Ireland]]_, or WSI, is the standard [[Steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Layout|layout]]/[[Steno Glossary#System|system]].

It's quite common for people new to steno to question the quality of WSI. It was created 115 years ago, surely it can't still be good today?

A few things to keep in mind:
1. Don't reinvent something that you don't understand
2. WSI is very much tried-and-tested, and there is no _speed_ benefit to using anything else
3. Designing a steno system is a ridiculously difficult thing to do (and it's something you should do _after_ becoming familiar with WSI)

To answer some of the questions I've seen floating around (although it's hard to find them so there are just a few):

> Why is the layout asymmetric?

Because English is asymmetric!

It's definitely possible to make a symmetric layout - I have in the past, and I've come to the conclusion that there is zero benefit in doing so. English is not a symmetric language, so it's rather silly to make a symmetric layout I think.

> Why not IPA?

The goal of steno is to be able to listen to someone speak and transcribe that into English. The difficulty of this problem mostly comes down to English being a very inconsistent language.

With written shorthand, or "non-realtime shorthand", you can transcribe words _exactly_ how they are said, and later, in a second step, translate those words into English. This was the job of a stenographer for a very long time, but it is not any longer.

Because the goal is to get to the English, we use a very loose system of writing words with a few phonemes and graphemes that we need in order to distinguish any word from any other while keeping the layout as small as possible.
