title: Theory in Practice
permalink: theory-in-practice

Very in-progress, but [[Home|I'm]] tired of leaving this uncommitted.

## Outline

A rough idea of what I'd like to talk about

- What is steno
- (Somewhere) What translations are, and what steno is actually for (translations are effects?)
- A brief history of shorthand and steno
- What is a dictionary (and entries, and mathematical functions)
- (Somewhere) How steno works, what is a steno engine (stateful transducers)
- What is a layout
- What is a theory, and how do they relate to dictionaries
- What are theory rules, and how do they relate to entries
- Briefs, fake words, shape based outlines, etc.
  - Brief families, rule-based briefs vs. arbitrary briefs, shape-based
  - How briefs relate (families and beyond)
- Conflicts in realtime theories and the types of conflicts in realtime theories. Begin to talk about theory complexity in general
- Outline splitting, and how it relates to word boundary conflicts
- Stroke splitting, how it really works, what's wrong with it, and how it could work
- Orthography, and that whole spectrum

Some theory ideas near and dear to my heart:
- Regular outlines grammars
- Orthospelling
- Programmatic dictionaries

Theory development:
- The process of theory development
- Rules
- Specifications
- Understanding of your own theory
- Dictionary building
- Layout development!

Some other ideas:
- Alternative theories
- split "tall" keys
- Key positions


[[Home|I've]] designed a few theories over the past year or so, and I'd like to share what I've learned over all that time.

These are just some potentially organized ramblings.
