Very in-progress, but [[Home|I'm]] tired of leaving this uncommitted.

Basically, I want to talk about how complex our theories are, how we got here, why it needs to change, and what can be done about it.

In the age of realtime theories, I think there's a lot more we can do.

This is a call-to-action that we need to be writing simpler theories if we want to make steno better, and more accessible.
