A page [[Home|I]] might like to write some day.

I think our [[Steno|steno]] [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theories]] have failed to adapt the the era of realtime. We are being crushed under the weight of complexity, and don't even know it.

There's a lot that can be changed, and should be changed.

This is a call-to-action that we need to be making simpler theories if we want to take steno into the future.

[[Pinchord|Pinchord]] is my best attempt to write an incredibly simple theory, you can check that out.

I've also written a bit about theory complexity related to [[Regular Outline Grammars]] and [[Generated Programmatic Dictionaries]] if you're interested.
