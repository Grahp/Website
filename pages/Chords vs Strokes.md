The difference between [[Steno Glossary#Chord|Chords]] and [[Steno Glossary#Stroke|Strokes]] in [[Steno|Steno]].

(Don't ask me why this page has 8 different URLs [[Home|I]] have literally no idea.)

Both strokes and chords are sets of [[Steno Glossary#Key|keys]]. They share identical structure.

When using sets of keys generically, the term _stroke_ is used. All chords are strokes.

The term _stroke_ encompasses all sets of keys. Thus, **all chords are strokes**.

Chords can be combined to form strokes. For example, the chord `TPH-` and the chord `OE` can be combined to form the stroke `TPHOE` ([[Steno Glossary#Entry|mapping]] to [[Steno Glossary#Translation|"no"]]).

Strokes are generally not combined to form new strokes. Strokes exist independently. Strokes are composed to form [[Steno Glossary#Outline|outlines]]. Composing the stroke `KUP` and `KA*EUBG` gives you `KUP/KA*EUBG` (mapping to "cupcake").
