- Come up with a better title, yeah?

- ViaVersion might not be the best solution
- A [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|from-scratch Minecraft Server]] might have a better option
- [[Home|I]] don't plan on making this, but I think it could be a good idea

- A service that provides client-abstraction, basically a unified model of what a client is that a custom [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft server]] could build around rather than being tied to a single version and using ViaVersion to crudely translate packets.
