[[Bowmap|Bowmap]]'s progress every day. [[Home|I'm]] making this to hold myself accountable, and so anyone can see my progress :p

See the [[Bowmap Roadmap|Bowmap Roadmap]].

My goal is to have some kind of tangible progress every single day.

## Progress

September 5, 2025, 133 days until release:
