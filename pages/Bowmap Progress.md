[[Bowmap|Bowmap]]'s progress every day. [[Home|I'm]] making this to hold myself accountable, and so anyone can see my progress :p

My goal is to have some kind of tangible progress every single day.

## Progress

October 7, 2025, 101 days until release

- Another time skip ._.
- Erm I got chunks working, at least chunks with only a single type of block in them
- And I broke the server and now I'm trying to fix it. I broke it like 2 days ago and now I honestly can't remember what's broken about it, so that's fun

September 27, 2025, 111 days until release

- Time skip, hello!
- Been a few days, got a little bit done, and a decent amount of thinking, but not much farther
- Next up is chunks, but there are some things I need to do before then.

September 22, 2025, 117 days until release

- More thinking, but nothing much yet

---

---

September 18, 2025, 121 days until release

- Bunch of codec work

---

September 14, 2025, 125 days until release

- Made identifier codec
- Begun working on registries :D

---

September 13, 2025, 126 days until release

- NBT codecs, almost finished them

---

September 12, 2025, 127 days until release

---

September 11, 2025, 128 days until release

---

September 10, 2025, 128 days until release

---

September 9, 2025, 129 days until release

- Nothing so far
- And then not much after that :p

- Some other misc cleanup at midnight :p

---

September 6, 2025, 132 days until release:

- Made the initial packet decoding transducer
- Worked on codecs (strings, arrays, all the varnums). I had these working previously through a complex codec abstraction that was really unnecessary, but it's been much easier this time

---

September 5, 2025, 133 days until release:

- Made a packet splitting transducer...
- Figured out what I think is a good model for decoding packets as they come in from the client!
