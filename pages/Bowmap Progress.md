[[Bowmap|Bowmap]]'s progress every day. [[Home|I'm]] making this to hold myself accountable, and so anyone can see my progress :p

See the [[Bowmap Roadmap|Bowmap Roadmap]].

My goal is to have some kind of tangible progress every single day.

## Progress

September 13, 2025, 126 days until release

- NBT codecs, almost finished them

September 12, 2025, 127 days until release

- Maybe some random code stuff, but no progress

September 11, 2025, 128 days until release

- Names of stuff?
- More configuration
- Uh oh, NBT...

September 10, 2025, 128 days until release

- Got codecs working with optionals
- Got to configuration!
- Did some more thinking about the future (why can't I be there and not here :p)

September 9, 2025, 129 days until release

- Nothing so far
- And then not much after that :p
- Did a little bit of work on codecs (stuck on optionals, but didn't spend that long working on them)

September 8, 2025, 130 days until release

- Some more clean up
- Open sourced what I have now :D
- Started on login step
- More Codecs (optional seems tricky...)

September 7, 2025, 131 days until release

- Got packet decoding working (a better system)
- Started working on packet encoding for clientbound packets. SLP tomorrow?
- SLP TODAY (I stayed up way too late lmao)
- Moved networking stuff out of the main logic.
- Some other misc cleanup at midnight :p

September 6, 2025, 132 days until release:

- Made the initial packet decoding transducer
- Worked on codecs (strings, arrays, all the varnums). I had these working previously through a complex codec abstraction that was really unnecessary, but it's been much easier this time

September 5, 2025, 133 days until release:

- Made a packet splitting transducer...
- Figured out what I think is a good model for decoding packets as they come in from the client!

September 4, 2025, 134 days until release:

- Made this and [[Bowmap Roadmap|the roadmap]]!
