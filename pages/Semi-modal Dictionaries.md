In [[Steno]], a semi-modal [[Steno Glossary#Dictionary|dictionary]] is a type of [[Steno Glossary#Modal|modal]] dictionary that uses a special grammar for its [[Steno Glossary#Stroke|strokes]] that allows you to escape the mode by writing any other stroke that isn't included in the grammar.

For example, you could have a semi-modal movement dictionary that [[Steno Glossary#Dedicated|reserves]] the `-R`, `-P`, `-B`, and `-G` keys for movement, while any other stroke will exit the mode.

This is the most common, and most useful, type of semi-modal dictionary - one that allows you to exit the mode by just writing normal English.


- This is one example of context aware dicts? Is it? or are all modal dicts context-aware? Or are modal dicts not context aware at all!
