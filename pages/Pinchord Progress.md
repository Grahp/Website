[[Home|My]] progress learning [[Pinchord|Pinchord]] every day!

Pinchord is a chorded typing system that I'm designing, you can read more about it on its page: [[Pinchord|Pinchord]].

November 20, 2025 - Day 5 of tracking:

- I think Pinchord is honestly quite close to being done, or being presentable anyway. It's probably just the last 20% of things like ortho suffixes and a few rogue chords that.
