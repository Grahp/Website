This page is (kinda) part of the [[Onyx Spec|Onyx Spec]].

[[Onyx|Onyx]] is an old phonetic [[Steno Glossary#Theory|theory]] that [[Home|I]] no longer use. A [[Steno Glossary#Dictionary|dictionary]] was never made, so this spec is everything around the theory.

I'm doing my best to specify the theory as it was so that these ideas may fuel your own theory development. I hope that they do so.

Many pages may be incomplete and/or out of date as I work through specifying something that I no longer use. Sorry!
