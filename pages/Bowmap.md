Bowmap is [[Home|my]] MMORPG [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft Server]] [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|written from scratch]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]]!

It's currently in development. Chapter 1 Alpha 1 will release on January 17, 2026! Check out the [[Bowmap Roadmap|Roadmap]] and the [[Bowmap Progress|Progress]].

You can read less on the website: [https://bowmap.net](https://bowmap.net)

Bowmap is [[Open Source|open source]], source code at [https://github.com/Bowmap/server1](https://github.com/Bowmap/server1)!

Not sure it will be open source in its entirety, and not just the core server logic, but for now it's all there :p

I would very much like to make a library for making custom [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft servers]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]]. I have been making Minecraft servers for pretty much my entire life, and the tools I need do not exist at the moment. That's why Bowmap has been taking so long to develop, and it's why I want to make open source tools of what I end up creating :D
