Bowmap is [[Home|my]] MMORPG [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft Server]] [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|written from scratch]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]]!

It's currently in development, and Chapter 1 Alpha 1 will be releasing on January 17, 2026!

If you're reading this at some point after this was written, there may be more on the website ([https://bowmap.net](https://bowmap.net))

Bowmap is actively being developed! See the [[Bowmap Roadmap|Bowmap Roadmap]].

Bowmap will not be open source, at least for the time being. I would very much like to make a library for making custom [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft servers]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]]. I have been making Minecraft servers for pretty much my entire life, and the tools I need to not exist at the moment. That's why Bowmap has been taking so long to develop, and it's why I want to open source the tools I create. This will come later down the line, though.
