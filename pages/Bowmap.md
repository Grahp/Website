Bowmap is [[Home|my]] MMORPG [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft server]] [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|written from-scratch]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]]!

It's currently in development. Chapter 1 Alpha 1 will release on January 17, 2026!

Check out the [[Bowmap Progress|Bowmap Progress]] page for what I've done every day (or, you know, whenever I remember to update it o-o)

You should join the Discord ([https://discord.gg/EVA5np6Dd6](https://discord.gg/EVA5np6Dd6)), lots of epic people there.

Source code is available (under GPL v2), at least for the time being. ([https://codeberg.org/Bowmap/Server](https://codeberg.org/Bowmap/Server))

Probably won't be open source in its entirety, but for now, it's all there.

I definitely want to make a [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft server]] library for [[Clojure|Clojure]] so that the next person doesn't have to go down the path I'm having to right now, but that also sounds like a lot of work, so I'm not sure.
