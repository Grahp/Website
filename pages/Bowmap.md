Bowmap is [[Home|my]] MMORPG [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft Server]] [[Minecraft Server From Scratch|written from scratch]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]]!

It's currently in development. Chapter 1 Alpha 1 will release on January 17, 2026! Check out the [[Bowmap Roadmap|Roadmap]] and the [[Bowmap Progress|Progress]].

Bowmap will not be [[Open Source|Open Source]], at least for the time being. I would very much like to make a library for making custom [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft servers]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]]. I have been making Minecraft servers for pretty much my entire life, and the tools I need to not exist at the moment. That's why Bowmap has been taking so long to develop, and it's why I want to open source the tools I create. This will come later down the line, though.
