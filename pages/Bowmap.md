Bowmap is [[Open Source|open source]], source code at [https://codeberg.org/Bowmap/Server](https://codeberg.org/Bowmap/Server)!

Not sure it will be open source in its entirety, and not just the core server logic, but for now it's all there :p

I really want to make a library for making custom [[Minecraft Server|Minecraft servers]] in [[Clojure|Clojure]]. I've been making Bowmap for a very long time, and I'm having to create the tools that I need to not go crazy. I'd like to open source those tools once I make them :D
